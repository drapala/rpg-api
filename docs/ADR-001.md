# ADR-001: Technology and Architecture Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The take-home assignment requires building a simple in-memory RPG character API.  
Even though persistence is not required, the solution should demonstrate production-ready thinking and good engineering practices.

Key considerations:
- Neo Financial is a fintech company, where Java/Spring Boot is a common stack.
- The system must be testable, extensible, and easy to reason about.
- The assignment will be evaluated by a technical recruiter looking for code quality and scalability mindset.

## Decision
We will implement the RPG API using **Spring Boot (3.5.x, Java 17)** with the following structure:
- **Controllers** to expose REST endpoints
- **Services** for business logic
- **Repositories** abstracting persistence (in-memory implementation)
- **DTOs** for input/output API contracts
- **Domain models** (`Character`, `Job`, `Stats`, `Battle`)

All state will be stored in memory, but the repository abstraction makes it trivial to swap for a real database later.

## Alternatives Considered
- **FastAPI (Python)**: Faster to prototype, but less aligned with enterprise fintech context.
- **Express.js (Node.js)**: Lightweight, but lacks type safety and strong enterprise adoption in this domain.
- **Direct Java main + servlets**: Too low-level, less maintainable, poor developer experience.

## Consequences
- ✅ Clear layering and SOLID adherence
- ✅ Easy to migrate from in-memory to database
- ✅ Strong test support with JUnit and Spring Boot Test
- ⚠️ Slightly more boilerplate than lighter frameworks
- ⚠️ Learning curve if the reviewer is not familiar with Spring Boot

## Notes
This ADR demonstrates professional decision-making even for a small assignment, showing how the system could scale into production.
